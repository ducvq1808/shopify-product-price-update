## Usage

**Step 2**: Open the interface to upload file at http://localhost:3000/

**Step 3**: Upload the csv file following correct format (see **uploads/sample.csv**) and click submit button



## Challenges

#### There is no GraphQL endpoint to get all products

-> Use GraphQL pagination

#### GraphQL API Rate Limit

-> Use ``shopify-api-node`` package which have build-in mechanisms for avoiding API Rate Limit.
